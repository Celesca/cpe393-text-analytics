This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "new_review = ['''I’ve waited for more than 2 years for this cinematic masterpiece to ultimately debut in theaters as the ultimate live-action Deadpool movie outing and it conveniently blew my expectations away by more than a mere potshot.\n",
        "To elucidate this belief in my case, I myself watched this film the first at Reading Cinemas Town Square on Tuesday July 30th, 2024 at 6:15PM, everything about this film was terrific, whether that be, (SPOILER-FREE CRITIQUE), a couple of cameos, comebacks, (the biggest being Wolverine and how well executed and stalwart the cast and crew remained for Hugh Jackman’s portrayal of the character, nice). The new characters were pretty phenomenal for everything that had been culminated into a presentation of greatness and cabaret no less. And also sorry for the 20th Century FOX universe about to be altered for eternity, (Diss to the knee, even with Blue Sky Studios), you shall be paid proper homage for your years of nostalgia, (if someone didn’t probably do so for you already). The cinematography was well mentally and crucially balanced for the tone of seriousness with gory violence and facetious humor that blew me away even for the 3rd time in a long time, (in forever), stellar portrayals for prom the thespians, (especially for the renowned Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as the prime eponymous protagonists).\n",
        "As for the prime antagonist, I wasn’t too agitated and irritably bothered by one of the antagonists being Cassandra Nova, (but that’s less incorrigibly made up for by Paradox, who I thought to be another different variant of Mobius, but I’m more than erroneous up to that particular point). The heavy emotions were carried out nicely as well as the choreography fight scenarios were in the least with a bundle of different ensemble characters from the past, (shan’t mention who specifically but good things come to those who wait, even if it isn’t everything everywhere all at once, ;) alluding to another 2022 multiverse movie). And did I forget to conscientiously mention about the costume designs for not merely Deadpool but also Wolverine, nice homage to the glorious late 30s comic-book accurate appeal, it’s rather satisfying and riveting for how well it was approached in that regard without being to mundane or that overall garnished somewhat. The music homages and the soundtrack was phenomenal as I almost forgot to mention for the prior precursors of Deadpool, (I’ll avow to not disclose), and hopefully maybe Deadpool won’t merely become Marvel Jesus and alter the course of the status quo of the MCU Phases 4 and beyond, can’t wait for much more in store becoming cooking up a  concocted pall.\n",
        "Overall, this true pure magnum opus is all the more breathtaking to say for the least that is truly, and might just practically even surpass its precursors by a mere milestone, this for me gets a 9.9/10, no more, no less. ''']\n"
